                Why is SHEIN So Cheap?
            </h3>
            <p className='text-base font-normal text-dark mb-3'>
                SHEIN is based outside the U.S., in China, and is known for keeping its operation costs low. Plus, SHEIN is a fast fashion brand. Items aren't made with super-high quality, or meant to be long lasting. It's a great way to get a quick fashion fix. To find clothing that fits your expectations, be sure to read the very thorough reviews that the site is famous for.

                How do I get free shipping at SHEIN?
            </h3>
            <p className='text-base font-normal text-dark mb-3'>
                SHEIN offers free standard shipping on all orders of $49 or more. Otherwise, you'll pay $3.99 for shipping ($12.90 for SHEIN express shipping). Sometimes they offer special promos for free shipping on any order, and certain clearance items sometimes ship for free. Be sure to check if a SHEIN promo code is needed to unlock free shipping.

                How long does SHEIN free shipping take?
            </h3>
            <p className='text-base font-normal text-dark mb-3'>
                Expect your order to take about two weeks or more to arrive at your doorstep when you select free shipping. That's because most SHEIN orders ship from China. Items that ship from a U.S. warehouse might arrive sooner.

                Yes, SHEIN coupons are almost constantly offered. You can find them here on RetailMeNot or on SHEIN's site. Almost every day brings a new flash sale promo code or percent-off discount code. You'll also find SHEIN coupons for free express shipping. Because SHEIN coupons are so plentiful, make sure you've installed RetailMeNot's free browser extension, Deal Finder, which finds and automatically enters the best promo code for you.

            </h3>

                How do I use a promo code on SHEIN.com?
            </h3>
            <p className='text-base font-normal text-dark mb-3'>
                On the checkout screen, there is a box to enter promo codes under “Order Summary.” All you need to do is add your chosen SHEIN discount code. While you can use a SHEIN coupon code or SHEIN promo code and SHEIN points together, you cannot stack SHEIN discount codes. Don't forget to check the fine print on your SHEIN coupon code to make sure it's valid for the clothing you want to buy.
